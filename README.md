## Tools

We are including a few tools for working with the natural language
datasets. These tools are written in C++ and Python and are built with
[Bazel](http://bazel.io). To compile and use these tools,
[install a recent version of Bazel](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html)
(minimally Bazel release 0.4.5 is required).
